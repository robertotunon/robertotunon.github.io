# This is my github page

While I get some time to write some quality content here you can check <a href="http://robertotunon.com" target="_blank">my portfolio site</a> to see some projects done and get my CV.

Also you can take a look to my <a href="http://robertotunon.com/bio" target="_blank">bio resume</a>

_*For the moment it's all only available in spanish, sorry!_
