title:  Where to start
---
If you're new to all of this, and just to give you a quick start, you should make sure you review four different resources:

1. **[Basic services:](/general/README.md)** Just to get started, the basic communication tools you'll need, a sort of checklist to make sure everything is on track.
2. **[Department-specific documentation:](#documentation-structure)** Here is where you can find all documentation that is specific to your department.
3. **[Our apps:](/general/ourapps.md)** Even though you only may be working on two or three apps, at any given time, there are plenty of projects going on. Read this to get to know past, present and future projects.
4. **[CHH Site:](http://www.creativehothouse.com)** Even though you've probably already seen this, don't miss the chance to look into it again, discover who your other workmates are in our other offices, see what everyone does, and discover a bit more about our mission with the [I've been a Child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypz6-2rCa9M) video.
